## Contents

- **Appendix_RH.html**  
  An HTML document presenting a proposed argument or partial proof for the Riemann Hypothesis, accompanied by references and attachments.

- **Evidence of equivalent conditions for the Riemann Hypothesis.pdf**  
  A PDF outlining several equivalent statements and known results that relate to the Riemann Hypothesis.

- **Guy_Robin_index.py / Guy_Robin.py**  
  Python scripts exploring the Guy–Robin inequality, an approach sometimes used to test implications related to RH.

- **Riemann_final.py / Riemann_hypothesis_finaly.py / Riemann_hypothesis_i9.py**  
  Various Python programs performing numerical experiments, approximations, and checks that aim to shed light on the Riemann Hypothesis.

- **Additional Files (Attachments 1, 2, etc.)**  
  Supplementary data, references, or code snippets supporting the HTML documents and Python scripts.

## Highlights

- **Testing & Numerical Exploration**  
  Multiple scripts allow you to experiment with zero-finding, inequalities, and other numerical aspects that might offer insights into the Riemann Hypothesis.

- **Proof Drafts & References**  
  The HTML file(s) (e.g., `Appendix_RH.html`) and PDF references contain attempts or outlines of proof strategies, along with known equivalent statements and supportive arguments.
